nastaliq.ttf 

	Home of this font on the Web (http://www.arbornet.org/~tabish/u-font) 
	says, and I quote: "Urdu Nastaliq Unicode is a Windows True-Type Urdu 
	Font which uses Unicode Arabic coding."
	
	A few features that makes it distinct from the rest of the efforts:

	1. Unicode implementation based on the following:
		a. Unicode Arabic Range 0600-06FF,
	   	b. Unicode Arabic Presentation Froms-A FB50-FDFF
		c. Unicode Arabic Presentation Forms-B FE70-FEFF
	2. Inclusion of word "Ka" and "Kal"
